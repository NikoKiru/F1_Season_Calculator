### What to add
 
- [x] Add names of races insted of numbers
- [x] Add points total to standings in views
- [x] Add drivers names 
- [x] Add graphs later on
- [x] Add table for individual standings
- [ ] Create page for see each number of times a driver has a position finish

- [x] 3. Code Refactoring and Abstraction. Problem: There is some code duplication, especially in the API endpoints where championship data is processed and formatted.Proposed Solution: I would create a helper function, something like format_championship_data(row), that takes a database row and returns a fully formatted dictionary. This function would handle splitting strings, looking up driver names, and calculating any other necessary fields.Benefits: This would reduce code duplication, make the API endpoints cleaner, and ensure that championship data is formatted consistently across the application.

- [x] Frontend ImprovementsProblem: The JavaScript code is currently embedded directly within the HTML templates.Proposed Solution: I would move all the JavaScript into separate .js files within the static directory. Each page that needs JavaScript would then include the relevant script file.Benefits: This is a standard best practice that improves code organization, makes the JavaScript easier to maintain and debug, and allows the browser to cache the scripts for better performance.

5. Add Unit and Integration Tests
Problem: The project currently lacks any automated tests.
Proposed Solution: I would introduce a testing framework like pytest and write a comprehensive suite of tests. This would include:
Unit tests for the data processing logic in commands.py and the business logic in logic.py.
Integration tests for the API endpoints to ensure they return the correct data and status codes.
Benefits: Tests are crucial for ensuring the application works as expected, and they give you the confidence to make changes and add new features without breaking existing functionality.
