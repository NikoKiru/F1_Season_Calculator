A Python-based tool to analyze Formula 1 championship scenarios. It calculates standings for every possible combination of races from a given season's data, providing insights into how the championship could have unfolded. The results are exposed through a Flask-based REST API.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Reads F1 race data from a CSV file.
- **Championship Simulation**: Generates all possible subsets of races to simulate different championship scenarios.
- **Standings Calculation**: Calculates the championship standings for each race combination.
- **Database Storage**: Stores all generated championship standings in a SQLite database.
- **REST API**: Exposes the championship data through a Flask API, allowing for easy querying of results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Pip for package management

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NikoKiru/F1_Season_Calculator.git
    cd F1_Season_Calculator
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1.  **Prepare Your Data**

    Create a `championships.csv` file in the root directory with the following format:
    - The first column should be `Driver`.
    - Subsequent columns should represent the points for each race.

    **Example `championships.csv`:**
    ```csv
    Driver,1,2,3
    VER,25,18,25
    NOR,18,25,18
    LEC,15,15,15
    ```

2.  **Generate Championship Data**

    Run the `f1.py` script to process the CSV and populate the SQLite database. This will create a `championships.db` file.
    ```bash
    python f1.py
    ```

3.  **Run the API Server**

    Start the Flask server to expose the API endpoints.
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The API will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## API Endpoints

The API provides several endpoints to query the championship data. All endpoints return data in JSON format.

An interactive Swagger UI is also available at `/apidocs/` when the server is running, which provides detailed documentation for all endpoints.

### Endpoint Summary

| Method | Endpoint                                               | Description                                                              |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GET`  | `/api/data`                                            | Returns all championship data from the database.                         |
| `GET`  | `/api/championship/<id>`                               | Returns data for a specific championship by its ID.                      |
| `GET`  | `/api/driver_wins/<abbreviation>`                      | Returns the total number of championships won by a driver.               |
| `GET`  | `/api/all_championship_wins`                           | Returns a summary of championship wins for all drivers.                  |
| `GET`  | `/api/highest_rounds_won`                              | Returns the highest number of rounds in a winning championship for each driver. |
| `GET`  | `/api/largest_championship_wins`                       | Returns championship IDs won by a driver with a specific number of races. |
| `GET`  | `/api/highest_position`                                | Returns the highest championship position achieved by each driver.       |
| `GET`  | `/api/head_to_head/<driver1>/<driver2>`                | Compares two drivers to see who finished ahead more often.               |
| `GET`  | `/api/min_races_to_win/<driver>`                       | Finds the minimum number of races a driver needed to win a championship. |
| `GET`  | `/api/most_common_runner_up`                           | Counts how many times each driver finished in second place.              |

### Example Requests

-   **Get all championship wins:**
    ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/all_championship_wins
    ```

-   **Get wins for a specific driver:**
    ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/driver_wins/VER
    ```

-   **Head-to-head comparison:**
    ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/head_to_head/VER/NOR
    ```

## Database Schema

The `championships.db` database contains a single table, `championship_results`, with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE championship_results (
    championship_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    num_races INTEGER,
    rounds TEXT,
    standings TEXT,
    winner TEXT
);
```
-   `rounds`: A comma-separated string of the race numbers included in the championship.
-   `standings`: A comma-separated string of driver abbreviations, ordered by their final rank.
-   `winner`: The abbreviation of the driver who won the championship.

Indexes are created on `winner` and `num_races` to improve query performance.
