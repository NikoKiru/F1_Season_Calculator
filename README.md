A Python-based tool to analyze Formula 1 championship scenarios. It calculates standings for every possible combination of races from a given season's data, providing insights into how the championship could have unfolded. The results are exposed through a Flask-based REST API and a user-friendly web interface.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Reads F1 race data from a CSV file.
- **Championship Simulation**: Generates all possible subsets of races to simulate different championship scenarios.
- **Standings Calculation**: Calculates the championship standings for each race combination.
- **Database Storage**: Stores all generated championship standings in a SQLite database.
- **REST API**: Exposes the championship data through a Flask API with interactive Swagger documentation.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly frontend to visualize and interact with the API endpoints.
- **Modular Architecture**: Built using the Flask Application Factory pattern and feature-based blueprints for better organization and scalability.
- **Custom CLI Commands**: Provides commands for easy database initialization and data processing.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a scalable Flask application with a modular, feature-based structure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Pip for package management

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NikoKiru/F1_Season_Calculator.git
    cd F1_Season_Calculator
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```powershell
    # For Windows (PowerShell)
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

**Note**: All commands should be run from the root of the project directory (`F1_Season_Calculator`).

1.  **Prepare Your Data**

    Ensure the `championships.csv` file is located in the `data/` directory. The format should be:
    - The first column must be `Driver`.
    - Subsequent columns represent the points for each race.

    **Example `data/championships.csv`:**
    ```csv
    Driver,1,2,3
    VER,25,18,25
    NOR,18,25,18
    LEC,15,15,15
    ```

2.  **Set the Flask Environment Variable:**
    The `.flaskenv` file should handle this automatically. If not, you can set it manually:
    ```powershell
    # For Windows (PowerShell)
    $env:FLASK_APP = "F1_Season_Calculator"
    ```

3.  **Initialize the Database:**
    This command creates the `championships.db` file in the `instance` folder with the correct schema.
    ```bash
    flask init-db
    ```

4.  **Process the Data:**
    This command reads the data from `data/championships.csv` and populates the database.
    ```bash
    flask process-data
    ```

5.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    -   **Web Interface**: Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
    -   **API Documentation (Swagger UI)**: Access the API docs at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/apidocs`

## API Endpoints

The API provides several endpoints to query the championship data. All endpoints return data in JSON format. An interactive Swagger UI is also available at `/apidocs/` when the server is running.

### Endpoint Summary

| Method | Endpoint                                | Description                                                              |
|--------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GET`  | `/api/data`                             | Returns paginated championship data from the database.                   |
| `GET`  | `/api/championship/<id>`                | Returns data for a specific championship by its ID.                      |
| `GET`  | `/api/all_championship_wins`            | Returns a summary of championship wins for all drivers.                  |
| `GET`  | `/api/highest_position`                 | Returns the highest championship position achieved by each driver.       |
| `GET`  | `/api/head_to_head/<driver1>/<driver2>` | Compares two drivers to see who finished ahead more often.               |
| `GET`  | `/api/min_races_to_win`                 | Finds the minimum number of races a driver needed to win a championship. |
| `GET`  | `/api/driver_positions`                 | Counts how many times each driver finished in a specific position.       |
| `GET`  | `/api/championship_win_probability`     | Returns the win probability for each driver based on season length.      |
| `GET`  | `/api/create_championship`              | Finds a championship from a list of rounds and redirects to its page.    |

### Example Requests

-   **Get all championship wins:**
    ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/all_championship_wins
    ```

-   **Head-to-head comparison:**
    ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/head_to_head/VER/NOR
    ```

-   **Get driver positions for 1st place:**
    ```bash
    curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/driver_positions?position=1"
    ```

## Database Schema

The `championships.db` database contains a single table, `championship_results`, with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE championship_results (
    championship_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    num_races INTEGER NOT NULL,
    rounds TEXT NOT NULL,
    standings TEXT NOT NULL,
    winner TEXT,
    points TEXT NOT NULL
);
```
-   `rounds`: A comma-separated string of the race numbers included in the championship.
-   `standings`: A comma-separated string of driver abbreviations, ordered by their final rank.
-   `winner`: The abbreviation of the driver who won the championship.
-   `points`: A comma-separated string of the total points for each driver, in the same order as `standings`.

Indexes are created on `winner`, `num_races`, and `rounds` to improve query performance.
